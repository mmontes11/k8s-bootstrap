Kubernetes cluster bootstrapping using [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/).

### Requirements

Make sure that the following cgroups are configured in both master and worker nodes (`/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`):
```text
cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=hugetlb
``` 

### Installation

Setup the controlplane on the master node by running:
```bash
sudo bash master.sh
```

Copy the generated configuration `config/kubeadm-join.yaml` to each worker node and run this command to join the cluster:
```bash
sudo bash worker.sh 
``` 

Run this on the controlplane node for bootstrapping the [infrastructure](https://github.com/mmontes11/k8s-infrastructure):
```bash
export GITHUB_USER=mmontes11
export GITHUB_REPO=k8s-infrastructure 
./bootstrap.sh
```
